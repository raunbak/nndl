# nndl
nndl is a pet project for building a basic neural network "library" in Python.
The core idea is based around building a Network object and adding layers to it,
as seen in other neural network implementations.

Work is very much in progress, and subject to change.

Large areas for continued work are as following:
Create a loss_function class - in order to easily add different types of losses rather than just RMSE.
Create an optimizer class - in order to easily add more optimizers than just SGD.

## Description
The "framework" is based on Python (3.6) with NumPy.
However testing the framework, using it and presenting results will use other libraries.  
I wanted to learn more on neural networks and have a project for doing more complete development.

## Acknowledgments
The idea came from a colleague at work pointing me towards http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com
